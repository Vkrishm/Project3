# Project3

Objective:
Analytics on EV and Hybrid cars in US with an objective to determine the following
-	Which are the best selling EV brands in the market?
-	How are sales of EV and Hybrid cars trending?
-	What % of EV chrging stations are public and % private
-	What is the density of these charging stations across US
Rationale
-	By analysing heat map businesses can potentially make commercial decisions of opening charging stations
-	Government can decide on public policies for comparable regions in population to incentivise EV+Hybrid uptake
-	Commercial pointers are made available to businesses in terms of investment decisions by further analysis car models and past trends
Limitations
-	Further studies may be needed to establish correlations between similar regions with varying sales and charging stations density
